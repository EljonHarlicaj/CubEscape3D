********** 3D world game based on Racket programming language *******************
Nothing professional, just the first ever 3D game on Racket language. (Maybe :D)
Play with it. Have fun. Change the code. Make a new.
This is school project made by Eljon Harlicaj and Lorenzo Vernaghi (andit is the
first thing we have ever coded)
