********** 3D world game based on Racket programming language *********
Nothing professional, just the first ever 3D game on Racket language.
Play with this (It is? We did not found others on the web), have fun. Change the code. Make a new.
This is school project made by Eljon Harlicaj and Lorenzo Vernaghi for
PF1 class.
